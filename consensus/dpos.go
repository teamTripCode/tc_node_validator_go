package consensus

// DPoS related types and logic have been moved to pkg/validation/dpos.go
// This file is kept for now to satisfy the Consensus interface implementation for DPoS,
// as methods for *validation.DPoS are still expected by the factory to fulfill the
// Consensus interface defined in this package.
//
// Ideally, if *validation.DPoS directly implements consensus.Consensus, this file
// might only need to contain DPoS-specific consensus message types or constants if any,
// or it could be removed if NewDPoS is also moved out of this package (e.g., to factory or validation).
// For now, NewDPoS remains here but returns *validation.DPoS.
//
// The methods that make *validation.DPoS implement consensus.Consensus are now
// in pkg/validation/dpos.go but with (d *validation.DPoS) receivers.
// The factory in this package will construct *validation.DPoS and return it as
// a consensus.Consensus interface.
//
// This file previously contained:
// - DPoS struct definition
// - Validator, DelegateInfo, ValidatorInfo struct definitions
// - NewDPoS constructor
// - All methods for DPoS
// - Functions like RegisterValidator, VoteForValidator, etc.
// These have been moved to pkg/validation/.
//
// The NewDPoS function is still defined in this file but its body might need adjustment
// if it's creating *validation.DPoS directly.
// Re-checking: NewDPoS was already changed to return *validation.DPoS and was
// moved to pkg/validation/dpos.go in the previous step.
// So this file, consensus/dpos.go, should be effectively empty or only contain
// elements that *must* remain in the `consensus` package for DPoS.
//
// Given that NewDPoS (the constructor for *validation.DPoS) is now in pkg/validation,
// and all methods are on *validation.DPoS within pkg/validation, this file
// consensus/dpos.go might not be needed at all if the factory directly calls
// validation.NewDPoS.
//
// Let's ensure the factory `consensus/factory.go` calls `validation.NewDPoS`.
// If so, this file `consensus/dpos.go` can indeed be empty or just contain the package declaration.
// The previous step moved all methods AND NewDPoS to pkg/validation/dpos.go.
// So, this file should be empty.

import (
	// Imports might be needed if there are any DPoS specific types
	// that are part of the `consensus` package itself and used by other
	// consensus algorithms or the factory in a generic way.
	// For now, assuming all DPoS specific logic is in `validation`.
